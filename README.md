## Amazon Redshift Tiered Storage

Amazon Redshift offers a common query interface against data stored in fast, local storage as well as data from high-capacity, inexpensive storage (S3). This workshop will cover the basics of this tiered storage model and outline the design patterns you can leverage to get the most from large volumes of data. You will build out your own Redshift cluster with multiple data sets to illustrate the trade-offs between the storage systems. By the time you leave, youâ€™ll know how to distribute your data and design your DDL to deliver the best data warehouse for your business.
